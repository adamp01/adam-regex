# Adam Regex

This project is intended as a learning resource for Rust, finite automata, and language interoperability. The goal is to build a working regex engine in Rust that can parse a string pattern and construct a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), which can then be used to match against user-supplied strings.

The engine will be exposed to Python via FFI, where it will be benchmarked against Python's built-in `re` module. Future work will likely include performance optimization, with an eye toward leveraging SIMD where applicable.
